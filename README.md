Dow Jones Industrial Average:-
      
                     The average is price weighted, and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently scaled. 
                    The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the                              component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index.
